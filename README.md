# scripts

Here we are keeping various scripts that may be usefull. README.md contains a listing of all scripts with descriptions.

**PS - powershell**


1. preview_pade_add.ps1 - adds file type to the windows explorer preview pane. Mostly for windows 10. 


**Python**


1. tail_log.py - small utility that can function as UNIX tail on windows. I couldn't get good results with PS so used Python for it.
