# scripts

Here we are keeping various scripts that may be usefull. README.md contains a listing of all scripts with descriptions.

**PS - powershell**


1. preview_pade_add.ps1 - adds file type to the windows explorer preview pane. Mostly for windows 10. 
2. earnperks.ps1 - restarts browser window every 30 minutes to prevent flash crashes. To run it use command: powershell  -ExecutionPolicy Bypass  "& ""C:\Dev\scripts\PS\earnperks.ps1"""


**Python**


1. tail_log.py - small utility that can function as UNIX tail on windows. I couldn't get good results with PS so used Python for it.
